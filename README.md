# Keyword Extractor Tool to HashTag Tool

#### A. **Overview:**
In this lab, we will gain hands-on experience with command-line tools in Python to perform ETL tasks. Specifically, the lab focuses on extracting keywords from transcriptions using the Keyword Extractor Tool and creating hashtags using the Hashtag Tool.
rom a transcription using the Keyword Extractor Tool.
